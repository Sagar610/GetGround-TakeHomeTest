GetGround-TakeHomeTest


Requirements
1. Using React, build a webapp that queries this paginated endpoint. Use Redux to save the results and then
print out the results as a list on the page.
2. The app should be paginated with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is refreshed, the
same results are shown).
3. Write at least one component as a React class based component (the rest can be functional components).
4. Write one unit test for a component and one test for the Redux reducer.
5. Host your code on Github, put all the code in a Pull Request against the (probably) empty repo.
Please also compile your files in a zip file and upload as well as your Github code.
